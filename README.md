SEDA-ML-Summarization-vagrant-config
====================================

The vagrant configuration for the SEDA-ML-Summarization component.

To enter the virtual environment, make sure you have vagrant installed. If not, read this: http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/installation/index.html

Then, run "vagrant up" when in the directory with the vagrantfile in it.

Then, run "vagrant ssh" and you're in! There should be a src folder where all code will reside.
